# Qlik Sense Extension: Reload and Replace a published app

Simple extension, that 
 * allows a developer to refresh an already published app with a new design from a copy of this app (standard process)
 * allows to reload the app without going through script editor (using QRS API - also works when app is already published)
 
## Virtual Proxy Setup

It is necessary to setup a virtual proxy first, so that the extension can authorize against it.
